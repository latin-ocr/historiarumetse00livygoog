books, is without notes, and otherwise is sar from being
prepared with so good judgment as the other, which is
accompanied by notes, generally in Latin, but sometimes
in German. All the extracts iu the later one are to be
found also in the present volume, besides others which the
purpose of the selection seemed equally to require. The
